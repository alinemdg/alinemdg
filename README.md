- 👋 Hi, I’m @alinemdg , you can call me Aline. I'm a 26 years old grammar nerd who started their career as an ESL teacher, then explored more uses of languages in marketing as a social media analyst and found out they were way better with data and performance analysis when they started working in the RH department of their company. 
Eventually, bringing back the passion for psychology through university, everything fell into place to lead them to becoming a data scientist. 

- 👀 I’m interested in everything related to psychology, which led me to falling in love with data science when I found out there is a way to combine both! Any behavioral data scientists out there? 🙌

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python for professional purposes and Java + HTML + CSS for fun. I'm also studying Spanish since I'm already fluent in English and Portuguese, and if none of those work, I'll play the piano and let music talk for me! 🎹

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that aim to better understand people and translate their characteristics into key information with meaningful intentions, such as performing analysis (mostly predictive and prescriptive) and improving AI learning to help impact society in a positive way.

- 📫 How to reach me: send and e-mail to aline.madoglio@gmail.com or drop cat memes on my instagram DMs at @miautistique.

- 😄 Pronouns: She/her; they/them.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I go deep into my research in every topic I'm interested in and I do best when I'm able to focus for long hours on a project, which I love doing. Am I a bookworm? No, I'm just autistic! 😆😹
